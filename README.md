# Real-Time Currency converter

In this project, I create for you an excel/vba application that will enable you to use real-time exchange rates to convert currency from one unit to another.
 it automates a data query in Excel, and link the results to an easy to-use VBA user form. 
The default date for the currency exchange is the current date, but this app allowed you to be able to enter in any historic date to obtain the exchange rates/converted values for times in the past.
 Finally, this User form generate a plot of exchange rates over the past 30 days.
